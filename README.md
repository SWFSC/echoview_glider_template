# Echoview_glider_template
US_AMLR Echoview glider template

This repo will have the Echoview glider templates that are used for analysis within the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program. 
These are living templates that will require raw acoustic data from either an AZFP or a Nortek mini sounder. 
The templates will also require GPS, pitch, roll and depth data in Echoview formats. Matlab files for processing Slocum G3 glider data to these files are found https://github.com/acossio/glider_processing_code
You will need an Echoview license to export the data from the templates.
